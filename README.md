## Description

  HomeSquad is a web app that aims to ceate a upwork like platform, but for physical works. On upwork and similar website you can hire peopele to do various taks for you, but all of the are done online. What if you want a physical work to be done like fix you washing machine or paint your walls, you can't get anyone who do those types of work on upwork. HomeSqauds aims to solve this very problem by creating a platform for homeowners and handymen to cominicate and get things done. Like in upwork and similar freelance sites employers can post job and look for biders and workers can also look for work that sites their skill sets.

While working on this project (my first big full stack app) I have learned how diffrent pices come together to build a fully functional web app. I used the MERN stack for this project and I have lerned about this stack quite alot while working on this project.
